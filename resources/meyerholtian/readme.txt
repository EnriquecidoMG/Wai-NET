Author's description:

This is a set of cursors that I have created containing all supported Windows cursors. (The Text Select and Precision Select cursors appear empty on this site, but they invert the stuff under it when used in Windows)

There is some sort of bug in Windows where custom cursors get reset to the default after a restart or shutdown. To counter this, a link to the cursors with the cursor installation .inf file can be found  [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F30XA2T8PflgH7nYgajDjE_cfB5L-b9D/view here]. Right click on the install .inf file, then select install.
